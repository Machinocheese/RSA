# RSA
A brief exploration into how RSA works


Some challenges I faced:
1. Understanding how RSA works (I basically read an article and tried to base my code off that info)
2. Coding the extended Euclidean algorithm (I initially intended to code it recursively but then that ended up being far more complicated, as recursion never really clicked for me)
3. Coding the modular exponentiation function (I encountered several issues with overflow along the way, and instead of resorting to limiting the size of the RSA output drastically, I instead decided to figure out how to use modular exponentiation with larger numbers).
